**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

Linking a minimal project that reproduces the issue may help:
- Keep it to a minimum, if possible no steps required after launching, or just press one key or button to trigger the test. The more complicated a project is, the more effort it takes to inspect, understand and isolate the issue.
- Remove any scripts, nodes and assets that aren't necessary to reproduce the issue.
- Don't use fullscreen or large screen size.
- If scripts are needed, prefer GDScript, as C# is harder to setup

If you see any errors in the console, that may also help.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Environment**
- OS: [e.g. iOS]
- Graphics card (you can find out in Godot's console log)
- Godot version [e.g. 4.1.1]
- Module version (or commit hash if you got it from Github directly)
- Renderer used
