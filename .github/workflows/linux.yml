      # Setup custom buildroot so we may use an old but compatible GLIBC version, while keeping recent toolchain.
      # This allows to make production builds that are compatible with older Linux distros.
      # TODO Enhancement: cache buildroot so future runs can use it?
      # TODO Enhancement: make buildroot setup a self-contained step. There are bits of setup elsewhere.
      #      Currently I also setup `PATH` in the Compilation step because modifications
      #      do not persist between steps (?). I also placed this step after checkout because the checkout step changes
      #      the working directory for all following steps.
