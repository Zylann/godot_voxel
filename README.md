Features
---------------------------

- Realtime 3D terrain editable in-game (Unlike a heightmap based terrain, this allows for overhangs, tunnels, and user creation/destruction)
- Godot physics integration + alternate fast Minecraft-like collisions
- Infinite terrains made by paging chunks in and out
- Voxel data is streamed from a variety of sources, which includes the ability to write your own generators
- Minecraft-style blocky voxel terrain, with multiple materials and baked ambient occlusion
- Smooth terrain with level of detail using Transvoxel
- Voxel storage using 8-bit or 16-bit channels for any general purpose
- Instancing system to spawn foliage, rocks and other decoration on surfaces

Roadmap
---------

These are some ideas that may or may not be implemented in the future:

* Texturing on smooth terrain
* Editor preview and authoring
* Improving LOD performance
* Other meshing algorithms (e.g. dual contouring)
* GPU offloading (Maybe when Godot 4+ supports compute shaders)
* Migrate to a GDNative plugin (post Godot 4, needs work)
