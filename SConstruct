# WARNING
# From a C++ developer point of view, the GodotCpp example and `.gdextension` files are confusing what the

# In this project, we consider `debug` means "unoptimized + debug symbols, big binary",
# while `release` means "optimized, no debug symbols, small binary".
# "editor" and "exported" should be separate concepts, which we had to define ourselves as `tools`.
# But in `.gdextension` files, `debug` actually means "editor", and `release` means "exported".
