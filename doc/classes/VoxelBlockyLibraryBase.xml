	<brief_description>
		Contains a list of models that can be used by [VoxelMesherBlocky].
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Models used by [VoxelMesherBlocky] must be baked before they can be used efficiently at runtime. The way this process happens depends on the implementation of this class. It can be a simple list of models, or a list of high-level types generating variant models. Check child classes for more information.

	<methods>
		<method name="bake">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Bakes the library. The data of models is optimized in order to combine them more efficiently when generating voxel meshes.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_materials" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Material[]" />
			<description>
				Gets a list of all distinct materials found in all models of the library.
				Note, if at least one non-empty model has no material, there will be one [code]null[/code] entry in this list to represent "The default material".

			Enable this option if you need normal mapping on your voxels. If you don't need it, disabling can reduce memory usage and give a small speed boost.
