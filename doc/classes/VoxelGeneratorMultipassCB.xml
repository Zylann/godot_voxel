	<brief_description>
		Scriptable generator working on columns of blocks and multiple passes.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This generator can be implemented with a script to generate terrain in columns of blocks instead of only block by block.
		It allows to use multiple passes, where every pass can access results of the previous ones, and allowing access to neighbor columns.
		The height of columns is not infinite, but it is possible to define what generates above and below, using a single-pass per-block fallback.
		It may only be used with [VoxelTerrain].

	<methods>
		<method name="_generate_block_fallback" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="out_buffer" type="VoxelBuffer" />
			<param index="1" name="origin_in_voxels" type="Vector3i" />
			<description>
				Called for every block to generate above or below the column-based region. For example you can decide to generate air above, and bedrock below.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="_generate_pass" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="voxel_tool" type="VoxelToolMultipassGenerator" />
			<param index="1" name="pass_index" type="int" />
			<description>
				Called once per pass for every column of blocks.
				The passed [code]voxel_tool[/code] must be used to get information about the area to generate, and fill/edit this area with voxels. Important: do not keep this object in a member variable for later re-use. You can only use it in the current call to this method.
				You may use [code]pass_index[/code] to do something different in each pass. For example, 0 could be base ground with Perlin noise, 1 could plant trees and other structures.

		</method>
		<method name="_get_used_channels_mask" qualifiers="virtual const">
			<return type="int" />
			<description>
				Use this to indicate which channels your generator will use. It returns a bitmask, so for example you may provide information like this: [code](1 &lt;&lt; channel1) | (1 &lt;&lt; channel2)[/code]
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="debug_generate_test_column">
			<return type="VoxelBuffer[]" />
			<param index="0" name="column_position_blocks" type="Vector2i" />
			<description>
				Testing method that will fully generate all blocks of a specific column, and returns them.
				This function doesn't use any threads and doesn't use the internal cache, so it will be very slow. However, it allows to test or debug your script more easily, using an isolated scene for example.

		</method>
		<method name="get_pass_extent_blocks" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<param index="0" name="pass_index" type="int" />
			<description>
				Gets how many blocks a pass can access around it (note: a block is 16x16x16 voxels by default).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_pass_extent_blocks">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="pass_index" type="int" />
			<param index="1" name="extent" type="int" />
			<description>
				Sets how many blocks a pass can access around columns when they generate (note: a block is 16x16x16 voxels by default).
				By design, the first pass is not allowed to access neighbors, so it will remain 0.
				Following passes are designed to access at least 1 block away. Such passes don't support 0 because it would be the same as simply putting your logic in a previous pass.
				Increasing extent will also increase the cost of the generator, both in memory and processing time, so it should be balanced with caution.
