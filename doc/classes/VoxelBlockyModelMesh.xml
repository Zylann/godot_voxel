		Generates a model based on a custom mesh.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[VoxelMesherBlocky] does not require models to be cubes. Ultimately, model visuals are all meshes. This is the most versatile option to make a model. The workflow is to make these models in a 3D editor such as Blender, making sure they are confined in a box going from (0,0) to (1,1). Textures are assigned with classic UV-mapping.

			Orthogonal rotation applied to the mesh when baking. Values are taken from the same convention as [GridMap] tiles.
			([GridMap] provides a conversion method from [Basis], unfortunately it is not a static method so it requires a [GridMap] instance to exist. A helper method could be added in the future if requested)

			Margin below which triangles located near one of the 6 sides of the voxel will be considered on that side. Triangles located on sides will be culled if they are occluded by neighbor voxels.
