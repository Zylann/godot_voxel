Scripting
=============

This page shows some examples in how to use the scripting API.


Editing the terrain
----------------------

### Using [VoxelTool](api/VoxelTool.md)

`VoxelTool` is a simplified API to access and modify voxel data. It is possible to obtain one from any class storing voxels, using the `get_voxel_tool()` function. That function will return a `VoxelTool` tied to the volume you got it from.

See [VoxelTool](api/VoxelTool.md) for available functions. Note, depending on which class you get it from, subclasses of `VoxelTool` may have more specialized functions.

It is possible to store a reference to `VoxelTool` in a member variable, in case you want to access voxels from the same volume many times. It is more efficient, because every call to `get_voxel_tool()` creates a new instance of it.

Before you start modifying voxels, make sure you access the right channel.

```gdscript
# If you use VoxelMesherBlocky
voxel_tool.channel = VoxelBuffer.CHANNEL_TYPE
```

```gdscript
# If you use VoxelMesherTransvoxel
voxel_tool.channel = VoxelBuffer.CHANNEL_SDF
```

```gdscript
# If you use VoxelMesherCubes
voxel_tool.channel = VoxelBuffer.CHANNEL_COLOR
```

### Boundary limitation

When a terrain is streaming blocks in and out, it is not possible to edit past loaded borders. Either you will get an error, or nothing will happen.
You can test if the area you want to access or edit is available by calling `VoxelTool.is_area_editable()`.


### LOD limitation

Similarly to bounds limitation, when you use LOD with `VoxelLodTerrain`, it is not possible to access or edit voxels beyond the first LOD level. Past this level, voxel data is no longer available at full resolution.


### Editing performance

In general, editing voxels one by one is the slowest. It is ok for actually getting only a few, but if you plan to modify larger areas at once, you may prefer functions that do this in bulk, or copy/paste buffers.

See [Access to voxels and multithreading](performance.md)


Custom generator
------------------

You can provide your own voxel generator by extending `VoxelGeneratorScript` in either GDScript, C# or C++.

!!! note
    custom generators can also be created without scripts, using [VoxelGeneratorGraph](generators.md)

### Example

#### With blocky voxels

Here is how to make a bare bones generator usable with a blocky terrain. Make sure you use `VoxelMesherBlocky` as mesher.

Create a standalone script `my_generator.gd` with the following contents:

```gdscript
extends VoxelGeneratorScript

const channel : int = VoxelBuffer.CHANNEL_TYPE

func _get_used_channels_mask() -> int:
    return 1 << channel
 
func _generate_block(buffer : VoxelBuffer, origin : Vector3i, lod : int) -> void:
	if lod != 0:
        return
	if origin.y < 0:
        buffer.fill(1, channel)
	if origin.x == origin.z and origin.y < 1:
        buffer.fill(1, channel)
```

In your terrain scene, add another script to a node, which will setup your generator when the game starts. Code might differ a bit depending on how you structure your scene.

```gdscript
extends Node # Or whatever your root node is
const MyGenerator = preload("my_generator.gd")

# Get the terrain
@onready var terrain = $VoxelTerrain

func _ready():
	terrain.generator = MyGenerator.new()
```

Make sure to have a `VoxelViewer` node in the scene under the camera. You may also want to move it up, look down, and add a `DirectionalLight3D` and `WorldEnvironment` (otherwise everything will look grey).

![Custom stream](images/custom-stream.jpg)

Though `VoxelBuffer.fill()` is probably not what you want to use, the above is a quick example. Generate_block generally gives you a block of 16x16x16 cubes to fill all at once, so you may also use `VoxelBuffer.set_voxel()` to specify each one individually.

#### With smooth voxels

Getting a similar result with smooth voxels like in the previous example is more tricky, so we'll switch to a different one.

First you have to change your mesher to `VoxelMesherTranvoxel`. Next, here is how you could generate ground with varying height:

```
# Change channel to SDF
const channel : int = VoxelBuffer.CHANNEL_SDF

func _generate_block(out_buffer : VoxelBuffer, origin_in_voxels : Vector3i, lod : int) -> void:
	# We'll have to iterate every 3D voxel in the block this time
	for rz in out_buffer.get_size().z:
		for rx in out_buffer.get_size().x:
			# The following part only depends on `x` and `z`, 
			# so moving it out of the innermost loop optimizes things a little.

            # Get voxel world position.
			# To account for LOD we multiply local coordinates by 2^lod.
			# This can be done faster than `pow()` by using binary left-shift.
            # Y is left out because we'll compute it in the inner loop.
			var pos_world := Vector3(origin_in_voxels) + Vector3(rx << lod, 0, rz << lod)

			# Generates infinite "wavy" hills.
			var height := 10.0 * (sin(pos_world.x * 0.1) + cos(pos_world.z * 0.1))

            # Innermost loop
			for ry in out_buffer.get_size().y:
				pos_world.y = origin_in_voxels.y + (ry << lod)

                # This is a cheap approximation for the signed distance of a heightfield
				var signed_distance := pos_world.y - height

				# When outputting signed distances, use `set_voxel_f` instead of `set_voxel`
				out_buffer.set_voxel_f(signed_distance, rx, ry, rz, channel)
```

With signed distance fields, negative values mean "inside" while positive values mean "outside". It is also important to output *gradients*, instead of just setting voxels to either 1 or 0. This is why we can't use `fill` here. In practice you 'll also want to use noise and actual SDF functions. See [Signed Distance Fields](smooth_terrain.md/#signed-distance-fields).

Further optimizations are also possible, for example if you know that the passed block is far enough to intersect any area where land features occur, you could do an early-return that outputs `fill_f(100.0)`. It's as a way to say "there is only air here and it's far from everything". Similarly, you can do `fill_f(-100.0)` to mean "there is only matter in this block and it's far from any surface".


### Thread-safety

Generators are invoked from multiple threads. Make sure your code is thread-safe.

If your generator uses resources or exports parameters that you want to change while it might be running, you should make sure they are read-only or copied per thread, so if the resource is modified from outside or another thread it won't disrupt the generator.

You can use `Mutex` to enforce single-thread access to variables that can be modified:

```gdscript
var _dictionary := {}
var _dictionary_mutex := Mutex.new()

func _generate_block(...):
    # ...

    _dictionary_mutex.lock()

    var x := 0
    if not _dictionary.has(key):
        _dictionary[key] = x
    else:
        x = _dictionary[key]
    
    _dictionary_mutex.unlock()

    # ...
```

However, mutexes must be used with a lot of care: if they are locked a lot of times or remain locked for too long, you could end up limiting performance to one thread (while the other waits for the lock to be released). If you use more than one and lock them in different orders, that can also lead to [deadlocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock).
Using Read-Write locks and thread-locals are good options depending on the situation, unfortunately the Godot script API does not provide this.

Careful about lazy-initialization, it can cause crashes if two threads run it at the same time. `Curve` is one of the resources doing that: if you call `interpolate_baked()` and it wasn't baked yet, it will be baked at the very last moment. That involves modifying internal states which might overlap with other threads doing the same thing. Here is an example of working around this:

```gdscript
const MountainsCurve : Curve = preload("moutains_curve.tres")

# This is called when the generator is created
func _init():
    # Call `bake()` to be sure it doesn't happen later inside `generate_block()`.
    MountainsCurve.bake()

# ...
```


Custom stream
---------------

Making a custom stream works similarly to a custom generator.

You have to extend the class `VoxelStreamScript` and override the methods `_load_block` and `_save_block`.
