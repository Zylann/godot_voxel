!!! note
    Disclaimer: this module is the result of hobbyist experiments around voxel terrains, and is by no means a fits-all solution. A lot of features are available and can be used for games, but some other parts are lacking or can change, so it's possible some information is not well detailed yet.
    It is also a lot more technical than usual Godot 3D features. You may have to tinker with things or even use C++, so having prior experience in 3D development is preferable.
