!!! note
    This module is under constant development. A lot of features are available and can be used for games, but some other parts still need work and can change, so it's possible some information is not well detailed yet.
    It is also a lot more technical than usual Godot 3D features. You may have to tinker with things, so having prior experience in 3D development is preferable.
