# VoxelBlockyLibraryBase

Inherits: [Resource](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_resource.html)

Inherited by: [VoxelBlockyLibrary](VoxelBlockyLibrary.md), [VoxelBlockyTypeLibrary](VoxelBlockyTypeLibrary.md)

Contains a list of models that can be used by [VoxelMesherBlocky](VoxelMesherBlocky.md).

## Description: 

Models used by [VoxelMesherBlocky](VoxelMesherBlocky.md) must be baked before they can be used efficiently at runtime. The way this process happens depends on the implementation of this class. It can be a simple list of models, or a list of high-level types generating variant models. Check child classes for more information.

## Enumerations:

enum **RoundingTaperProfile**:

- <span id="i_ROUNDING_TAPER_LINEAR"></span>**ROUNDING_TAPER_LINEAR** = **0** --- Linear transition: t. Here t is normalized distance through the taper.
- <span id="i_ROUNDING_TAPER_EASE_IN"></span>**ROUNDING_TAPER_EASE_IN** = **1** --- Quadratic ease-in transition: t squared. Here t is normalized distance through the taper.
- <span id="i_ROUNDING_TAPER_EASE_OUT"></span>**ROUNDING_TAPER_EASE_OUT** = **2** --- Quadratic ease-out transition: 1 minus (1 minus t) squared. Here t is normalized distance through the taper.
- <span id="i_ROUNDING_TAPER_SMOOTHSTEP"></span>**ROUNDING_TAPER_SMOOTHSTEP** = **3** --- Smoothstep transition: t squared times (3 minus 2 times t). Here t is normalized distance through the taper.


## Constants: 

- <span id="i_MAX_MODELS"></span>**MAX_MODELS** = **65536**
- <span id="i_MAX_MATERIALS"></span>**MAX_MATERIALS** = **65536**

## Property Descriptions

### [float](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_float.html)<span id="i_rounding_amount"></span> **rounding_amount** = 0.1

Shared bevel radius in voxel units, clamped to 0 through 0.25. Values below 0.001 are treated as zero to keep generated triangles stable at floating-point mesh precision. Zero disables rounding geometry. Only models with [VoxelBlockyModel.rounding_enabled](VoxelBlockyModel.md#i_rounding_enabled) enabled and supported cube geometry are affected. Bake the library and remesh affected terrain after changing this at runtime.

### [float](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_float.html)<span id="i_rounding_taper_distance"></span> **rounding_taper_distance** = 0.4

Distance in voxel units along an edge over which its bevel transitions to full width, clamped to 0.01 through 1.0. Values 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 mean 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% of one voxel edge. This setting is independent of the bevel radius. Bake the library and remesh affected terrain after changing this at runtime.

### [RoundingTaperProfile](VoxelBlockyLibraryBase.md#enumerations)<span id="i_rounding_taper_profile"></span> **rounding_taper_profile** = ROUNDING_TAPER_LINEAR (0)

Shape of the edge transition over [rounding_taper_distance](VoxelBlockyLibraryBase.md#i_rounding_taper_distance), independent of [rounding_amount](VoxelBlockyLibraryBase.md#i_rounding_amount). Bake the library and remesh affected terrain after changing this at runtime.

### [bool](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_bool.html)<span id="i_bake_tangents"></span> **bake_tangents** = true

Enable this option if you need normal mapping on your voxels. If you don't need it, disabling can reduce memory usage and give a small speed boost.

## Method Descriptions

### [void](#)<span id="i_bake"></span> **bake**( ) 

Bakes the library. The data of models is optimized in order to combine them more efficiently when generating voxel meshes.

### [Material[]](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_material[].html)<span id="i_get_materials"></span> **get_materials**( ) 

Gets a list of all distinct materials found in all models of the library.

Note, if at least one non-empty model has no material, there will be one `null` entry in this list to represent "The default material".
