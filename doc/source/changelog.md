Changelog
============

This is a high-level list of features, changes and fixes that have been made over time.

At the moment, this module doesn't have a distinct release schedule, so this changelog follows Godot's version numbers and binary releases. Almost each version mentionned here should have an associated Git branch (for THIS repo, not Godot's) containing features at the time of the version. Backports aren't done so far.

Semver is not yet in place, so each version can have breaking changes, although it shouldn't happen often across minor versions.


1.2.dev - ongoing development - `master`
--------------------------------------

Primarily developped with Godot 4.2.

- Added `ZN_SpotNoise`, exposing the same algorithm as the `SpotNoise2D` and `SpotNoise3D` nodes of graph generators
- Saving with `save_all_modified_blocks` now automatically flushes eventual caches implemented by `VoxelStream` upon completion
- `VoxelTool`:
    - Added `grow_sphere` as alternate way to progressively grow or shrink matter in a spherical region with smooth voxels (thanks to Piratux)
- `VoxelLodTerrain`:
    - `save_all_modified_blocks` now returns a completion tracker similar to `VoxelTerrain`
    - Added new optional LOD streaming system `Clipbox` (advanced settings):
        - Uses concentric boxes instead of octree traversal, although some logic remains similar to what an octree does
        - Supports multiple viewers
        - Supports collision-only viewers
        - Adds secondary LOD distance parameter controlling the extents of LOD1 and beyond, separately from LOD0 (unused in the legacy system)
        - Has its own limitations and pending improvements, may be addressed over time
        - The original system is now referenced as "Legacy Octree".
- `VoxelStream`:
    - Added `flush` method to force writing to the filesystem in case the stream's implementation uses caching

- Fixes
    - Fixed chunk loading was prioritized incorrectly around the player in specific game start conditions
    - Fixed `"plugins_list.has(p_plugin)" is true` errors in the editor, at the cost of slight behavior changes. This was caused by existing workarounds to prevent UIs from hiding unexpectedly, which were modified to avoid the error, but are still needed unfortunately.
    - `VoxelLodTerrain`: `VoxelTool.do_point` and `set_voxel` were not always updating meshes near chunk borders, leaving holes
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: Fixed ambiguous voxel texture indices produced by `OutputSingleTexture` caused painting to fail in some situations

- Breaking changes
    - `VoxelToolMultipassGenerator`: changed `get_editable_area_max` to return an exclusive position instead of inclusive


1.1 - 29/12/2023 - `1.1`
---------------------------------

Primarily developped with Godot 4.1

- General
    - Added shadow casting setting to both terrain types
    - Added editor shortcut to re-generate the selected terrain
    - Added support for block generation on the GPU (only available with generators that support both CPU and GPU, for now `VoxelGeneratorGraph` only).
    - Updated FastNoise2 to 0.10.0-alpha
    - Started an experimental type system for the blocky voxels workflow. However it is not fully functional, its API may change in the future or have parts removed.
    - Added experimental `VoxelAStarGrid3D` for grid-based pathfinding on blocky voxels 
    - Added experimental `VoxelGeneratorMultipassCB` to implement column-based generation in multiple passes that works across chunks
    - Added `render_layers_mask` property to `VoxelTerrain` and `VoxelLodTerrain`
    - Voxel engine processing no longer stops when the SceneTree is paused
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`:
        - Added `Spots2D` and `Spots3D` nodes, optimized for generating "ore patches"
        - Added shader support for `FastNoiseGradient2D` and `FastNoiseGradient3D` nodes
        - Added bilinear filter option to the `Image` node
        - Editor: reworked context menu to add nodes, similar to VisualShader. Now has search bar, tree view and node descriptions.
        - Editor: added copy/paste with Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V shortcuts
    - `VoxelGraphFunction`:
        - Editor: the graph will now get compiled while editing, which provides some checks
        - Editor: I/Os are setup automatically when the graph is compiled by default. Manual setup might be exposed in the future if necessary.
    - `VoxelTerrain`:
        - Added `VoxelTerrainMultiplayerSynchronizer`, which simplifies replication using Godot's high-level multiplayer API
        - Added `is_area_meshed` as an alternative to `VoxelTool.is_area_editable` for games using mesh colliders
        - Added `do_path` to build or carve "worms" of varying radius
        - Editor: added warning when bounds are empty
    - `VoxelTool`:
        - Added `smooth_sphere`, which smoothens terrain in a spherical area using box blur. Smooth/SDF terrain only. (Thanks to Piratux for the idea and initial implementation)
        - Separated `paste` into `paste` and `paste_masked` functions. The latter performs masking using a specific channel and value.
    - `VoxelToolTerrain`:
        - Raycasting a terrain using `VoxelMesherBlocky` now takes collision boxes into account (thanks to Lry722)
    - `VoxelToolLodTerrain`:
        - Added support for `paste`
    - `VoxelMesherCubes`:
        - Added helper function to convert an image into a 1-voxel thick "sprite mesh"
    - `VoxelInstancer`:
        - Added `get_library_item_id` on multimesh instances with physics body nodes, so raycasts hitting them can tell which item they are
    - `VoxelInstanceGenerator`:
        - Added noise graph property, so instances can also be filtered with a custom VoxelGraphFunction
    - `VoxelInstanceLibrary`:
        - Added `get_all_item_ids()` to allow iterating over all items of a library
    - `VoxelLibraryMultiMeshItem `:
        - Added `render_layer` property (thanks to m4nu3lf)
        - Added `gi_mode` property
        - Exposed custom distance ratios for the secondary distance-based LOD system
        - Added option to hide instances when beyond their max distance-based LOD (only relevant for terrains with no LOD, or on the last LOD of `VoxelLodTerrain`)
        - Node groups on the template scene are now added to instance colliders if present
    - `VoxelLodTerrain`:
        - Added debug drawing for modifier bounds
        - Added `is_area_meshed` as an alternative to `VoxelTool.is_area_editable` for games using mesh colliders

    - `VoxelVoxLoader`:
        - Added parameter to allow loading data in a custom channel (instead of the color channel)
    - `VoxelBlockyModel`:
        - Added 3D preview in editor
        - Added ability to rotate the model in editor (not just for preview, actually rotate the baked model)
        - Changed names to be handled with `Resource.name`, so it also shows them in the list of models in the editor
        - Added `culls_neighbors` property to control whether the sides of a model can cull sides of other models (thanks to spazzylemons)

- Fixes
    - Fixed editor not shrinking properly on narrow screens with a terrain selected. Stats appearing in bottom panel will use a scrollbar if the area is too small.
    - `VoxelBoxMover`: Workaround floating point error with stair climbing, which could cause characters to fall through the step (depends on gameplay code inducing errors when converting the returned motion)
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`:
        - Fixed crash if a graph contains a node with both used and unused outputs, and gets compiled with `debug=false`
        - Fixed error when adding Constant nodes
        - Fixed graph not always saving when saving the scene
        - Fixed shader generator crash when a node has an unconnected input
        - Fixed cellular noise when used on GPU
        - Fixed Image node issues when sampling at negative coordinates
    - `VoxelGraphFunction`:
        - Fixed default input values were not properly loaded
        - Fixed unexpected "missing node" error when more than one custom inputs are used
    - `VoxelInstancer`:
        - Fixed crash when hiding the node in the editor
        - Fixed crash when closing the scene while an instancer node is selected
        - Fixed instances were not cleared when using the "Re-generate" menu in the editor when terrain shape changed
    - `VoxelInstanceLibrary`: 
        - Fixed `find_item_by_name` was not finding items
        - Fixed newly added items in the editor rendering badly by default when the terrain doesn't have LOD. For now they always default to LOD 0 instead of LOD 2.
    - `VoxelTerrain`: Fixed crash when the terrain tries to update while it has no mesher assigned
    - `VoxelLodTerrain`: Fixed error spam when re-generating or destroying the terrain
    - `VoxelMesherBlocky`: Fixed materials "wrapping around" when more than 256 are used. Raised limit to 65536.
    - `VoxelMesherTransvoxel`: Removed rare degenerate/microscopic triangles, which caused errors with Jolt Physics. However, doing those checks makes meshing about 15% slower (untextured).
    - `VoxelStreamRegionFiles`: Fixed `block_size_po2` wasn't working correctly
    - `VoxelToolTerrain`: Fixed terrain was not marked as modified when setting voxel metadata
    - `VoxelToolLodTerrain`: 
        - Fixed `stamp_sdf` wasn't working due to an error when providing a baked mesh
        - Fixed `set_voxel` was creating artifacts
        - Fixed `separate_floating_chunks` was creating artifacts
    - `VoxelMeshSDF`: fixed saved resource was not loading properly

- Breaking changes
    - `VoxelBlockyLibrary`:
        - Changed the list of models to be handled by a typed array instead of individual properties. When opened in the editor, old resources will get converted. Re-save them to make the conversion persist.
    - `VoxelBlockyModel`:
        - The class was split into several subclasses for each type of geometry. When opened in the editor, old resources will get converted, but only if they are part of a `VoxelBlockyLibaray`. They won't work if they are individual resource files.
    - `VoxelNode`:
        - Removed `GIMode` enum, replaced with `GeometryInstance3D.GIMode`


1.0 - 12/03/2023 - `godot4.0`
------------------------------

Godot 4 is required from this version.

- General
    - Added `gi_mode` to terrain nodes to choose how they behave with Godot's global illumination
    - Added `FastNoise2` for faster SIMD noise
    - Added experimental support functions to help setting up basic multiplayer with `VoxelTerrain` (might change in the future)
    - Improved support for 64-bit floats
    - Added `ZN_ThreadedTask` to allow running custom tasks using the thread pool system
    - Added `VoxelMeshSDF` to bake SDF from meshes, which can be used in voxel sculpting.
    - Mesh resources are now fully built on threads with the Godot Vulkan renderer
    - Editor: terrain bounds are now shown in the inspector as min/max instead of position/size
    - Added `do_hemisphere` to `VoxelToolTerrain` and `VoxelToolLodTerrain`, which can be used as flattening brush
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: added support for outputting to the TYPE channel, allowing use with `VoxelMesherBlocky`
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: editor: unconnected inputs show their default value directly on the node
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: editor: allow to change the axes on preview nodes 3D slices
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: editor: replace existing connection if dragging from/to an input port having one already
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: editor: creating noise and curve nodes now auto-create their resource instead of coming up null
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: editor: added pin button to keep the graph editor shown even after deselecting the terrain.
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: editor: added popout button to open the graph editor in a separate window
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: added comment nodes

    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: added math expression node
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: added Pow and Powi nodes
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: Clamp now accepts min and max as inputs. For the version with constant parameters, use ClampC (might be faster in the current state of things).
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: Added per-node profiling detail to see which ones take most of the time
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: Added "live update" option, to automatically re-generate the terrain when the graph is modified
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: Some nodes have default input connections, so it's no longer required to connect them manually to (X,Y,Z) inputs
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: Added minor optimization to share branches of nodes doing the same calculations
    - `VoxelInstancer`: Added support for `VoxelTerrain`. This means only LOD0 works, but mesh-LODs should work.
    - `VoxelInstancer`: Editor: added basic UI to see how many instances exist
    - `VoxelInstancer`: Allow to dump VoxelInstancer as scene for debug inspection
    - `VoxelInstancer`: Editor: instance chunks are shown when the node is selected
    - `VoxelInstancer`: Changing mesh block size should no longer make saved instances invalid if they were saved with a different mesh block size
    - `VoxelInstanceLibraryMultiMeshItem`: Support setting up mesh LODs from a scene with name `LODx` suffixes
    - `VoxelInstanceLibraryMultiMeshItem`: Support setting a scene directly, which is converted to multimesh at runtime (fixes a few workflow issues: updates automatically when scene changes, doesn't create mesh and texture copies in the `.tres` file when using imported scenes)
    - `VoxelLodTerrain`: exposed debug drawing options for development versions

- Smooth voxels
    - SDF data is now encoded with `inorm8` and `inorm16`, instead of an arbitrary version of `unorm8` and `unorm16`. Migration code is in place to load old save files, but *do a backup before running your project with the new version*.
    - `VoxelTool`: Added `set_sdf_strength()` to control brush strength when sculpting smooth voxels (previously acted as if it was 1.0)
    - `VoxelLodTerrain`: added *experimental* `full_load_mode`, in which all edited data is loaded at once, allowing any area to be edited anytime. Useful for some fixed-size volumes.
    - `VoxelLodTerrain`: Added optional calculation of distant normalmaps to improve LOD quality. It can also run on the GPU for faster execution (`VoxelGeneratorGraph` only).

    - `VoxelLodTerrain`: added debug gizmos to see mesh updates
    - `VoxelToolLodTerrain`: added *experimental* `do_sphere_async`, an alternative version of `do_sphere` which defers the task on threads to reduce stutter if the affected area is big.
    - `VoxelToolLodTerrain`: added `stamp_sdf` function to place a baked mesh SDF on the terrain
    - `VoxelToolLodTerrain`: added `do_graph` to run a custom brush based on `VoxelGeneratorGraph` in a specific area. An `InputSDF` node was added in order to support SDF modifications.
    - `VoxelMesherTransvoxel`: initial support for deep SDF sampling, to affine vertex positions at low levels of details (slow and limited proof of concept for now).
    - `VoxelMesherTransvoxel`: Variable LOD: regular and transition meshes are now combined in one single mesh per chunk. A shader is required to render it, but creates far less mesh resources and reduces the amount of draw calls.

- Blocky voxels
    - `VoxelMesherBlocky`: materials are now unlimited and specified in each model, either as overrides or directly from mesh (You still need to consider draw calls when using many materials)
    - `VoxelMesherBlocky`: each model can have up to 2 materials (aka surfaces)
    - `VoxelMesherBlocky`: mesh collisions: added support for specifying which surfaces have collision
    - `VoxelBoxMover`: added basic support for stair climbing

- Fixes
    - `VoxelBlockyLibrary`: the editor no longer crashes some time after having null model entries.
    - `VoxelBlockyModel`: properties of the inspector were not refreshed when changing `geometry_type`
    - `VoxelBuffer`: frequently creating buffers with always different sizes no longer wastes memory
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: editor: fix inspector starting to throw errors after deleting a node, as it is still inspecting it

    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: fixed Image2D node not accepting image formats L8 and LA8
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: fixed memory leaks when the graph contains resources
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: some specific node graphs were not ordered properly
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: SmoothUnion and SmoothSubtract were causing branches to be incorrectly skipped by runtime optimization, leading to empty blocks
    - `VoxelGeneratorFlat`: fixed underground SDF values being 0 instead of negative
    - `VoxelInstancer`: fix instances not refreshing when an item is modified and the mesh block size is 32
    - `VoxelInstancer`: fix crash when removing an item from the library while an instancer node is using it
    - `VoxelInstancer`: fix errors when removing scene instances
    - `VoxelInstancer`: fix position issues when scene instances are saved
    - `VoxelInstancer`: fix position issues when instances are saved while mesh block size is set to 32
    - `VoxelLodTerrain`: fix `lod_fade_duration` property was not accepting decimal numbers
    - `VoxelLodTerrain`: Cracks no longer appear at seams when LOD fading is enabled
    - `VoxelMesherCubes`: editor: color mode is now a proper dropdown
    - `VoxelMesherCubes`: fixed raw color mode not working properly

    - `VoxelMesherTransvoxel`: fixed occasional holes and "spikes" in geometry in some specific configurations
    - `VoxelStreamScript`: fix voxel data not getting retrieved when `BLOCK_FOUND` is returned
    - `VoxelTerrain`: fixed `Condition "mesh_block == nullptr" is true` which could happen in some conditions
    - `VoxelTerrain`: changing a material now updates existing meshes instead of only new ones
    - `VoxelTool`: `raycast` locking up if you send a Vector3 containing NaN
    - `VoxelToolLodTerrain`: fix inconsistent result with integer `do_sphere` radius
    - `VoxelToolTerrain`: `run_blocky_random_tick` no longer snaps area borders to chunk borders in unintuitive ways

- Breaking changes
    - Some functions now take `Vector3i` instead of `Vector3`. If you used to send `Vector3` without `floor()` or `round()`, it can have side-effects in negative coordinates.
    - `VoxelTerrain`: the main way to specify materials is no longer here, but in meshers instead.
    - `VoxelLodTerrain`: `set_process_mode` and `get_process_mode` were renamed `set_process_callback` and `get_process_callback` (due to a name conflict)
    - `VoxelLodTerrain`: `has_block` was renamed `has_data_block`
    - `VoxelMesherTransvoxel`: Shader API: The data in `COLOR` and `UV` was moved respectively to `CUSTOM0` and `CUSTOM1` (old attributes no longer work for this use case)

    - `VoxelStream`: renamed `immerge_block` => `save_voxel_block`
    - `VoxelStreamScript`: renamed `_emerge_block` => `_load_voxel_block`
    - `VoxelStreamScript`: renamed `_immerge_block` => `_save_voxel_block`
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: the `Select` node's `threshold` port is now a parameter instead.
    - `FastNoiseLite` was renamed `ZN_FastNoiseLite`, as now Godot 4 comes with its own implementation, with a few differences.
    - Removed `VoxelStreamBlockFiles`

- Known issues
    - Some nodes and resources no longer start with predefined properties due to a warning introduced in Godot4 when properties are resources.
    - SDFGI does not work all the time and can only be forced to update by moving away and coming back, pre-generating the terrain, or toggling it off and on. This is a limitation of Godot not supporting well meshes created dynamically.

------------------------------------

This branch is the last supporting Godot 3

    - `VoxelInstancer`: fix errors when removing scene instances
    - `VoxelStreamScript`: fix voxel data not getting retrieved when `BLOCK_FOUND` is returned
    - Terrain was not visible if a room/portals system was used. For now it is not culled by rooms.

    - `VoxelToolLodTerrain`: added a function to separate floating chunks as rigid-bodies in a specified region
    - `VoxelInstanceGenerator`: added extra option to emit from faces more precisely, especially when meshes got simplified (slower than the other options)
    - `VoxelInstancer`: added menu to setup a multimesh item from a scene (similarly to GridMap), which also allows to set up colliders
    - `VoxelInstancer`: added initial support for instancing regular scenes (slower than multimeshes)
    - `VoxelInstancer`: added option to turn off random rotation
    - `VoxelInstanceLibrary`: moved menu to add/remove/update items to the inspector, instead of the 3D editor toolbar

- Breaking changes
    - `VoxelBuffer`: channels `DATA3` and `DATA4` were renamed `INDICES` and `WEIGHTS`
    - `VoxelInstanceGenerator`: `EMIT_FROM_FACES` got renamed `EMIT_FROM_FACES_FAST`. `EMIT_FROM_FACES` still exists but is a different algorithm.
    - `VoxelServer`: `get_stats()` format has changed, check documentation
    - `VoxelLodTerrain`: `get_statistics()` format has changed: `time_process_update_responses` and `remaining_main_thread_blocks` are no longer available
    - `VoxelLodTerrain`: Maximum LOD count was decreased to 24, which is still largely enough. Higher maximums were likely to cause integer overflows.
    - `VoxelTerrain`: `get_statistics()` format has changed: `time_process_update_responses` and `remaining_main_thread_blocks` are no longer available
    - `VoxelViewer`: `requires_collisions` is now `true` by default

- Fixes
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: changes to node properties are now saved properly
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: fix some per-thread memory not freed on exit
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph`: `debug_analyze_range` was crashing when given a negative-size area
    - `VoxelBuffer`: `copy_voxel_metadata_in_area` was checking the source box incorrectly
    - `VoxelBuffer`: multiple calls to `create()` with different sizes could lead to heap corruption if a channel was not uniform
    - `VoxelBuffer`: `copy_channel_from_area` could lead to heap corruption if the source and destination had the same size and were copied entirely
    - `VoxelMesherTransvoxel`: no longer crashes when the input buffer is not cubic
    - `VoxelLodTerrain`: fixed errors and crashes when editing voxels near loading borders
    - `VoxelLodTerrain`: fixed crash occurring after a few edits when LOD count is set to 1

    - `VoxelTool` channel no longer defaults to 7 when using `get_voxel_tool` from a terrain with a stream assigned. Instead it picks first used channel of the mesher (fallback order is mesher, then generator, then stream).
    - `VoxelInstancer`: fixed error when node visibility changes
    - `VoxelInstancer`: fixed no instances generated when density is 1 in vertex emission mode

    - `VoxelStreamSQLite`: fixed blocks above LOD0 being saved at wrong locations, causing them to be reloaded often floating in the air
    - Fix some crashes occurring when all PoolVector allocs are in use (Godot 3.x limitation). It will print errors instead, but crashes can still occur inside Godot's code as it's not often checking for this
    - Fix some crashes occurring when negative sizes are sent to AABB function parameters


0.4 - 09/05/2021 - `godot3.3`
-----------------------

- General
    - Introduction of `VoxelServer`, which shares threaded tasks among all voxel nodes

    - Added a utility class to load `.vox` files created with MagicaVoxel (scripts only)
    - Voxel nodes can be moved, scaled and rotated
    - Voxel nodes can be limited to specific bounds, rather than being infinitely paging volumes (multiples of block size).

    - Added About window

- Smooth voxels
    - Shaders now have access to the transform of each block, useful for triplanar mapping on moving volumes
    - Transvoxel runs faster (almost x2 speedup)
    - The SDF channel is now 16-bit by default instead of 8-bit, which reduces terracing in big terrains
    - Optimized `VoxelGeneratorGraph` by making it detect empty blocks more accurately and process by buffers
    - `VoxelGeneratorGraph` now exposes performance tuning parameters
    - Added `SdfSphereHeightmap` and `Normalize` nodes to voxel graph, which can help making planets
    - Added `SdfSmoothUnion` and `SdfSmoothSubtract` nodes to voxel graph
    - Added `VoxelInstancer` to instantiate items on top of `VoxelLodTerrain`, aimed at spawning natural elements such as rocks and foliage
    - Implemented `VoxelToolLodterrain.raycast()`
    - Added experimental API for LOD fading, with some limitations.

- Blocky voxels
    - Introduced a second blocky mesher dedicated to colored cubes, with greedy meshing and palette support
    - Replaced `transparent` property with `transparency_index` for more control on the culling of transparent faces
    - The TYPE channel is now 16-bit by default instead of 8-bit, allowing to store up to 65,536 types (part of this channel might actually be used to store rotation in the future)
    - Added normalmaps support
    - `VoxelRaycastResult` now also contains hit distance, so it is possible to determine the exact hit position
    - `VoxelBoxMover` supports scaled/translated terrains and `VoxelMesherCubes` (limited to non-zero color voxels)
    - `VoxelColorPalette` colors can be edited in the inspector
    - `VoxelToolTerrain.raycast` accounts for scale and rotation, and supports VoxelMesherCubes (non-zero values)

- Breaking changes
    - `VoxelViewer` now replaces the `viewer_path` property on `VoxelTerrain`, and allows multiple loading points
    - Defined `COLOR` channel in `VoxelBuffer`, previously known as `DATA2`
    - `VoxelGenerator` is no longer the base for script-based generators, use `VoxelGeneratorScript` instead
    - `VoxelGenerator` no longer inherits `VoxelStream`
    - `VoxelStream` is no longer the base for script-based streams, use `VoxelStreamScript` instead
    - Generators and streams have been split. Streams are more dedicated to files and use a single background thread. Generators are dedicated to generation and can be used by more than one background thread. Terrains have one property for each.
    - The meshing system no longer "guesses" how voxels will look like. Instead it uses the mesher assigned to the terrain.
    - SDF and TYPE channels have different default depth, so if you relied on 8-bit depth, you may have to explicitely set that format in your generator, to avoid mismatch with existing savegames
    - The block serialization format has changed, and migration is not implemented, so old saves using it cannot be used. See documentation for more information.
    - Terrains no longer auto-save when they are destroyed while having a `stream` assigned. You have to call `save_modified_blocks()` explicitely before doing that.
    - `VoxelLodTerrain.lod_split_scale` has been replaced with `lod_distance` for clarity. It is the distance from the viewer where the first LOD level may extend. 

- Fixes
    - C# should be able to properly implement generator/stream functions

- Known issues
    - `VoxelLodTerrain` does not entirely support `VoxelViewer`, but a refactoring pass is planned for it.


0.3 - 08/09/2020 - `godot3.2.3`
--------------------------

- Editor
    - Terrain nodes now render in the editor, unless scripts are involved (can be changed with an option)

- Blocky voxels
    - Added collision masks to blocky voxels, which takes effect with `VoxelBoxMover` and voxel raycasts
    - Added random tick API for blocky terrains
    - Blocky mesh collision shapes now take all surfaces into account

- Fixes
    - Fixed crash when `VoxelTerrain` is used without a stream
    - Fixed `Voxel.duplicate()` not implemented properly
    - Fixed collision shapes only being generated for the first mesh surface
    - Fixed `VoxelTool` truncating 64-bit values


0.2 - 27/03/2020 - (no branch) - Tokisan Games binary version
--------------------------------------------------------

- General
    - Optimized `VoxelBuffer` memory allocation with a pool (best when sizes are often the same)
    - Optimized block visibility by removing meshes from the world rather than setting the `visible` property
    - Added customizable bit depth to `VoxelBuffer` (8, 16, 32 and 64 bits)
    - Added node configuration warnings in case terrain nodes are wrongly setup
    - Implemented VoxelTool for VoxelBuffers
    - Added `VoxelStreamNoise2D`
